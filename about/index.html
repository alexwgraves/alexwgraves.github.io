          Hi! I'm Alex, a recent graudate of the University of Pennsylvania's School of Engineering, where I studied <a class="colorlink" href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd_program.html" target="_blank">Digital Media Design</a>.
          This is a computer science major with a concentration in computer graphics.
          I also minored in French and Francophone Studies.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          My core courses involved projects like creating <a href="/code/mini-minecraft/" class="colorlink">Mini Minecraft</a> in C++ with OpenGL and building a <a href="/code/path-tracer/" class="colorlink">path tracer</a> from scratch.
          For my senior project, I built a user input-based <a class="colorlink" href="https://github.com/alexwgraves/ville" target="_blank">procedural city generator</a>.
          Other computer science courses I've taken include Data Structures and Algorithms, Databases and Information Systems, Big Data Analytics, Ruby on Rails Web Development, and Computer Organization and Design.
          I also took a number of art classes, including <a class="colorlink" href="/art-design/3d-computer-modeling">3D Computer Modeling</a> and Drawing.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          Outside of academics, I spent most of my time at <a class="colorlink" href="https://thedp.com" target="_blank">The Daily Pennsylvanian</a>, where I was most recently the Director of Web Development, in 2018.
          I oversaw a team of developers as well as a range of projects including <a href="https://github.com/dailypenn/eventsatpenn" class="colorlink" target="_blank">full-scale apps</a>, <a href="https://projects.thedp.com" class="colorlink" target="_blank">project pages</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dailypenn/data" class="colorlink" target="_blank">data journalism</a>.
          In 2017, I was the Digital Director. In that role I oversaw digital strategy and creative direction, and managed seven digital departments, including web development, video, and design.
          In 2016, I was a Design Editor, and helped to shift the DP's design team from a print-focused department to one that also focused on graphics and working closely with the web team.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          Additionally, I worked regularly as a designer (generally on graphic design, projections, or sound) on the productions of Penn's various theater companies.
          I was also a member of Penn's chapter of <a class="colorlink" href="https://ostem.org" target="_blank">oSTEM</a>.
